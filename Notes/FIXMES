Not needed for running for getting me to debug and use
  load more buttons for goals page, hours worked, project goals



debouncing buttons

Total Weekly Goal
*****  Total Weekly Goal Load more button
*****  Update the design of the view / oval of hours and percent

Charts
  Get Daily Weekly Monthly Hours range
    arrow button ups range dependent on monthIndex
  Stats
    total sum all hours no filter
    Avg Daily, weekly Monthly
      grab first secondsWorked[0] sorted dateIndex, weekIndex, monthIndex,
      subtract from current index and divide, daily weekly, monthyl
    Avg weekday
      const WeekdayHours = {Sun-Sat}
      case statement if startTime.getDay is day of week, add it
      Use getDailySecondsWorked that alreay exist, just add weekIndex if statement
      divide via the number of weeks from avg weeklyGoal
    Chart data being displayed string
      Add year index
      Monthly shows a year of data 2020 - year index
      Daily Shows a month at a time

Settings
**** Restore modal type stuff
  Restore Project, - green color
  SubTask Mode - last

Hours Worked screen
*****  load more button, only do like a week at a time

Edit Project
*******  delete project with modal, and message you can alway restore in the Settings
    filter all data on projects that are not deleted, string builder filter???

Never use props for an item passed into another screen, example pass project in
pass only id and grab the realm object. I think the prop stays static if a ream update happens
while the state gets updated. Plus we grab the realm object anyways and pass into statemen






******  Project Task update the design of the view

Remove Action Screen data and just put in data without action screen

People friendlyFi the app

Timer screen new design
  link to people grinding
  block sites
  motivate
  connect
  help
  focus app view with the oval start timer button and 4 buttons at borderBottomWidth

ViewVisibleWrapper active to visible :(







Stuff I probably won't do

Time Selector, calendar and confirmation modals can be a single component with a child.
The child detirmines the width????
Probably not worth the rework effort

Styles file for each folder

I hate the way I handle colors using the global variable, yucky :( lol

getHours worked function that is a getsecondsworked wrapper
