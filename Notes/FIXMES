Sub Task mode?

Hours worked redesign
  start end time am pm format and eliminate seconds
  delete hours Worked - add deleted true false boolean
  no subtask to add
  oscillating colors for each hours worked for visual effect???? Maybe just the divider

default a subtask on the timer screen

People friendlyfi and motivations and shit

Weekly Goal oval and hours and percent

Future shit
  strava network like idea
  logistics - adam, tuni, ideas







debouncing buttons

ViewVisibleWrapper active to visible :(

Stuff I probably won't do

Time Selector, calendar and confirmation modals can be a single component with a child.
The child detirmines the width????
Probably not worth the rework effort

Styles file for each folder

I hate the way I handle colors using the global variable, yucky :( lol

getHours worked function that is a getsecondsworked wrapper



Closing the app a big problem

Siri -  are you still working
	Heading to work - what does that 7 hours means, time heading to work, time is the trigger, work category
	Still heading to work say done when there and the prompt keeps returning

Make it as easy as possible

Giving it a personality -  tell joe Iâ€™m going to work

Make it a companions a buddy.

App identity thing that keeps you a companion, that got your back .

Motivation quotes

Virtual assistant proactive - it starts understanding

Calendar - parse from a  calendar and that triggers your app.
	How do you simplify, phone there to help, not in way and personality to interact.

Jeeves and Wooster. The app is a trusted proactive assistant, parse calendar, talk to it, reminds you.

Gotta be a way

will this be helpful or annoying.
