Settings
**** Restore modal type stuff
  Color Scheme - last
  Restore Project, - green color
  SubTask Mode - last


Hours Worked screen
*****  load more button, only do like a week at a time

Edit Project
*******  delete project with modal, and message you can alway restore in the Settings
    filter all data on projects that are not deleted, string builder filter???

Never use props for an item passed into another screen, example pass project in
pass only id and grab the realm object. I think the prop stays static if a ream update happens
while the state gets updated. Plus we grab the realm object anyways and pass into statemen






******  Project Task update the design of the view

Remove Action Screen data and just put in data without action screen

People friendlyFi the app

Timer screen new design
  link to people grinding
  block sites
  motivate
  connect
  help
  focus app view with the oval start timer button and 4 buttons at borderBottomWidth

ViewVisibleWrapper active to visible :(







Stuff I probably won't do

Time Selector, calendar and confirmation modals can be a single component with a child.
The child detirmines the width????
Probably not worth the rework effort
