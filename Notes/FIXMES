Load more weekly goals, project goals, hours worked

Proper code clean up (general clean too), especially realm crashing with invalidated object

Iphonify




Sub Task mode?

Hours worked redesign
  start end time am pm format and eliminate seconds
  delete hours Worked - add deleted true false boolean
  no subtask to add
  oscillating colors for each hours worked for visual effect???? Maybe just the divider

default a subtask on the timer screen

People friendlyfi and motivations and shit

Weekly Goal oval and hours and percent

Future shit
  strava network like idea
  logistics - adam, tuni, ideas







debouncing buttons

ViewVisibleWrapper active to visible :(

Stuff I probably won't do

Time Selector, calendar and confirmation modals can be a single component with a child.
The child detirmines the width????
Probably not worth the rework effort

Styles file for each folder

I hate the way I handle colors using the global variable, yucky :( lol

getHours worked function that is a getsecondsworked wrapper
